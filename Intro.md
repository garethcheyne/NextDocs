**Subject:** Volunteers Needed: Commercial Product Repository (CPR) Concept Review

---

Good morning,

We are beginning development on a conceptual application to centrally manage product meta information, and I need some volunteers to review the current state of the project and provide valuable feedback to help shape the concept.

### Project Overview

The objective of this concept is to establish a **Central Product Repository**, or **"Commercial Product Repository" (CPR)**, where all product meta information is created, approved, and made ready for distribution across all teams and systems.

### Key Benefits

- **Single Source of Truth**: One centralized repository for all product information
- **Consistency**: Ensure uniformity across all franchises and channels
- **Efficiency**: Reduce repetitive product data entry and maintenance across different systems
- **Quality Control**: Strict data consistency with approval workflows

### What the CPR Will Include

The Commercial Product Repository will house:
- Marketing text and descriptions
- Product imagery and assets
- Technical specifications
- Metadata and categorization
- Approval status and version control

### Integration Capabilities

The CPR is designed to connect with:
- **Dynamics 365 Commerce (CC)**
- **Dynamics 365 Business Central (BC)**
- Any other destination system capable of consuming an API

### Call to Action

If you're interested in participating in this review and helping shape the future of our product information management, please reach out. Your expertise and feedback will be invaluable in ensuring this system meets our organization's needs.
