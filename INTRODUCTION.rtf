{\b\fs28 Subject: NextDocs - Enterprise Documentation Platform Ready for Production Review}\par\par

Morning,\par\par

As you are aware, I have been working on a project in my personal time and have progressed it to a beta-ready situation. I would like to present NextDocs for consideration as a production solution to address our Commercial Application Team (CAT) documentation and knowledge management challenges.\par\par

{\b\fs26 PROJECT OVERVIEW}\par\par

NextDocs is an enterprise documentation platform designed to serve as a single source of truth for all CAT team resources, including documentation for {\b Dynamics 365 CE}, {\b Dynamics 365 BC}, {\b Deliver Ezy NZL}, and other commercial applications, along with release notes and user feedback forums. The application is built on a modern technology stack consisting of {\b Next.js v16}, {\b PostgreSQL} with vector indexing for advanced search capabilities, {\b Redis} for query caching, and comprehensive backup services.\par\par

{\b\fs26 RECOMMENDATION}\par\par

While NextDocs is currently in {\b beta status}, I recommend proceeding with a phased production implementation to gather real-world feedback essential for platform evolution. Without actual user engagement on our own applications, it would be difficult to identify improvement opportunities and optimize the platform for our specific CAT team needs.\par\par

I recommend beginning with a pilot application (such as {\b Dynamics 365 CE} or {\b Deliver Ezy NZL}) to validate the workflow integration and gather user feedback, followed by a rollout across Dynamics 365 BC and all other commercial applications managed by the CAT team. The platform is production-ready with enterprise security standards met and comprehensive operational procedures established.\par\par

I would welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the platform and discuss the implementation timeline and resource requirements.\par\par

{\b\fs26 NEXT STEPS:}\par
\bullet Schedule demonstration session with CAT team leadership\par
\bullet Review technical architecture with IT security team\par
\bullet Define pilot commercial application and CAT user group success metrics\par
\bullet Establish CAT team implementation timeline and resource allocation\par
